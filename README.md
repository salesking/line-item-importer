# SalesKing Line Item Importer

A SalesKing app to import csv files. As a starting point you can import
contacts given as csv f.ex exported from Outlook.

## Developer Info

The app is build with Rails 4 and Ruby 2+ and is working with
MySQL or PostgreSQL.
It uses oAuth2 and has a canvas integration, so a user can use
it inside SalesKing.

### Development Dependencies

Assets are managed via bower and the bower-rails gem. So you should have the 
following running:

* nodejs
* bower

Clone assets into /vendor/assets/bower_components

    rake bower:install

## Getting Started

1. Register a new app to get an app-id & secret in your SalesKing account. (salesking.eu/developer/apps)

    * Set a unique CANVAS SLUG so it can be reached inside salesking.eu/app/my-import
    * Set the Canvas URL to `http://MY-URL:Port/login` <- /login receives the auth POST when a user opens the app in sk/app/my-import

2. Checkout this repo, copy and edit `salesking_app.yml` & `database.yml`.

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails s

3. Go into SalesKing at `/app/your-canvas-slug`
    
4. SSL Restrictions in browsers will prevent iFrames to load (your local) http-site 
into the https-enabled SalesKing install. In Google Chrome look at the very 
right site of the url-input where an icon appears to allow such content.


## Run on Heroku

This app is deployed on Heroku and [you can do it too](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar). The only problem to be
solved is the creation of the salesking_app.yml keeping the app
key & secret.
Instead of using [Heroku's env_vars](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) you should use a separate
local git branch where you add the ignored `salesking_app.yml` file:

    # create a new branch
    git checkout production
    # [create salesking_app.yml, remove from .gitignore and commit]
    git merge master
    git push heroku production:master
    # change back to master branch for normal edits .. DO NOT merge production into master
    git checkout master

DON'T FORGET: never push production to your public branch, if you do you need to setup NEW app credentials

## Translating line-item-importer

- Edit the translations directly on the [salesking/line-item-importer](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/6762) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

If you need to pull/push locales:

  localeapp install --standalone <API Key>
  
And than edit the config file in .localeapp/config.rb


Happy translating!

## Test

Run specs with

    bundle exec rake spec

Test coverage report is created by simpleCov and available after running the
specs
